John Steinbeck’s novel, Of Mice and Men, was first published in 1937. 
At the time, America was still suffering the grim aftermath of the depression and the itinerant workers 
who form the basis of the novel were very much within the consciousness of a nation separated by wealth yet driven by the idea of ‘the American dream’. Steinbeck’s novel is, however, essentially a tale of loneliness, of men struggling alone against a cold, uncaring and faceless destiny.
